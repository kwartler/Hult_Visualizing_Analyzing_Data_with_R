# Basic Exploration - The revised version removes all lyrics but instead has a simple word count for each song and the cumulative sum of words spoken by millisecond. 
head(allSongs$Song1..Post.Malone.)


# Get the last values for each song (total words but now with time) - within the list, the "tail" function grabs the last row of each song.  Think of this as grabbing the last single row of each worksheet and capturing that informaiton in a separate worksheet.
totalWords <- lapply(allSongs, tail,1)
totalWords <- do.call(rbind, totalWords)
rownames(totalWords) <- NULL
head(totalWords)

# Get the timeline of a song - This function combines ("row-bind") all the data frames in the list to one object.  Notice how "allsongs" in your environment has 30 elements (dataframes) while now "songTimeline" has 2476 rows and 3 variables.  Think of this like a copy/paste of each workbook underneath to form one long running single work sheet. 
songTimeline  <- do.call(rbind, allSongs)

# Make a plot of the speech cadence - Now we build a plot, ggplot is complext but essentially we are building the visualization layer by layer and have complete control over each layer.  First a blank plot layer, then the lines are added, then the end point is added, then the text and finally some aethetics like a theme and removing the legend.  Dont worry about this section as we will cover more visuals in detail and entire courses are spent on visualization.
