1/2 done!  Making progress but adding a lot of comments for people

1. slide clutter - agenda, objective, data overview
2. narration - cadence
3. report - 
>>section headers including executive summaries

>>data specificity - "top categories include office supplies" vs "top categories include office supplies (6000).""

>>grammar
"Three are the area this report will be focusing on"

>>past vs present tense
"This information allows us to understand our business..." [past] to future tense "we can make informed business decisions..." [future] within the same paragraph

>>active vs passive voice
Be more clear and direct.  You're the expert!
"Office supplies lead in frequency, indicating stable demand."
VS 
"The demand for office supplies is stable, as shown by their leading frequency."
Passive voice often has verbs am, is, are, was, were, be, being, been) followed by a past participle (usually ending in "-ed")

>>overly verbose
 "to ensure they are leading to effective purchase incentives without diminishing profits"
